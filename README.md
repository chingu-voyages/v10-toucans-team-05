# Momentum Clone Project

---

The Momentum clone is a basic frontend webpage that visually looks similar to the [Chrome extension](https://momentumdash.com/).

Visual elements include a personalized greeting, a high-quality photo background, current location and weather display, and a motivational quote.

Productivity tools include customized links, embedded Google search, customizable "main task," and to-do list.
